# anki-ppd: Snap package for Anki

Anki is a program which makes remembering things easy. Because it's a lot
more efficient than traditional study methods, you can either greatly
decrease your time spent studying, or greatly increase the amount you learn.

This snap ships the upstream binary releases with as few changes as possible.
If you are looking for actual builds from source, consider the `anki-woodrow` snap (https://snapcraft.io/anki-woodrow).
This snap is not affiliated with the upstream project in any way.
